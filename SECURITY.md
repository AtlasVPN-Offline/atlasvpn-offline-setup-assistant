# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is an educational tool, we do not have a formal versioning and support schedule. We will always address security reports for the latest version of the code in the `main` branch.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team and community take all security bugs in this project seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts to disclose the issue responsibly.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the "Report a vulnerability" feature in GitHub.

Alternatively, you can send an email to the project maintainers at `security@example.com` (note: this is a placeholder, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

You should expect a response within 48 hours.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a vulnerability report, they will:

1.  Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2.  Audit code to find any similar problems.
3.  Prepare a fix for the `main` branch.
4.  Release a new version with the fix.

We will do our best to credit the reporter of the vulnerability.
